**TL;DR** Becoming a software engineer is difficult in general and arguably much more difficult without a Computer Science degree, but it's not impossible.  With a lot of preparation and a little bit of luck, you can do it too!

It's no secret that software engineering is one of the most coveted career paths today.  With high compensation, great benefits, and engaging work, it's tough to beat, especially considering all of this is attainable at the entry-level.

Getting a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science is currently the most common way to become a software engineer, but it's not an absolute requirement.  In my case, I was able to break into the field through several relevant experiences along the way.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Management with a concentration in Computer Science and a minor in Math, so technically speaking, one could argue that I have what's equivalent to about half a degree in Computer Science.  With that said, during my undergraduate studies, I meandered through many different concentrations and minors.  That indecision led to a very incomplete and insufficient education in core Computer Science topics.

After graduation, I started my career as an IT Analyst at an insurance company, primarily because it was the closest thing to software development out of the options I had.  After a couple of months, I had the opportunity to transition to a DevOps-focused team, where I spent about two years.  I became familiar with version control, CI/CD, cloud development, and basic scripting.  Over time, I regretfully became bitter about the job because I felt held back.  The environment was slower-paced than I would've liked, and the scope of work felt limited.

In retrospect, I think my time in that role was a very gentle and necessary introduction to software development.  It laid the foundation for me to start building on.

I had initially considered enrolling in a boot camp or a Master's program to fill in the many gaps that I had but decided to try the self-taught route first.  At the time, [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) was the closest thing I found to a structured DIY guide to learning everything I thought I needed.  I started many of the recommended books but finished none of them, and I quickly realized that thoroughly reading each book was not realistic for me.

As a result, I shifted my strategy to focusing only on what seemed necessary for the technical interviews: data structures, algorithms, and general system design principles.  I used the Cracking the Coding Interview book for most of my preparation, and I also completed many coding problems on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) using Python (the only language I knew).

While I was a few months into my preparation, recruiters from a few reputable tech companies contacted me.  Although I felt under-prepared, I decided to interview anyway to get some experience under my belt.  After several stressful weeks, I got an offer from my first choice and accepted without hesitation.

In my opinion, two critical factors that led to my success were building a toolkit that I was comfortable using and creating a framework for technical interviews.  I completed many practice problems with the same data structures and algorithms, and I didn't spend much time on more complicated ones that I didn't feel confident using yet.  Also, I consistently followed a series of steps: ask clarifying questions, restate the problem, explain my approach, and talk through my thought process.

My interviews were far from perfect, but I did well enough with what I knew.  I was also upfront about what I didn't know, which led to productive conversations with the interviewers that showed that I could learn quickly.

I still feel like all of the stars aligned during my preparation and interviews, and although it was an arduous and overwhelming process, it was well worth it.  I'm very grateful for being where I am today, and I strongly encourage anyone considering a career in software engineering to give it a shot.
